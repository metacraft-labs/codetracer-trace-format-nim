# --- VENDOR-BLOCK BEGIN ----------------------------------------------------
# VENDORED COPY -- DO NOT EDIT HERE FIRST
#
#   upstream:  metacraft-labs/codetracer-trace-format
#   path:      ci/check-ci-refs.sh
#   revision:  f09a2525b4818c0d23d960224838b4a2b175a1cc
#
# This file is byte-identical to upstream except for this block. It carries
# no knowledge of either repository: everything repo-specific arrives through
# $WORKFLOW_DIR and $SELF_REPO_URL (the latter defaulting to this repo's
# `origin`). Keep it that way, so the two copies stay diffable by `cmp`.
#
# WHY A COPY, RATHER THAN A SHARED ACTION
#
# The obvious home is `metacraft-labs/metacraft-github-actions`, which both
# repos already consume. It was rejected for one reason: this gate exists to
# detect `uses:` references that have rotted, and a gate delivered BY a
# `uses:` reference can be disabled by the very defect it looks for. An
# absent action fails loudly, so that case is survivable -- but a shared
# action pinned at a frozen `main` is the quiet regime this script's own
# `check_pinned_ref` treats as fatal: it would resolve, run a stale gate,
# and report success. A checker must not depend on the thing it checks.
#
# The cost of a copy is silent drift, so drift is made loud instead. The
# `vendored copy matches upstream` step in ci-refs.yml strips the block
# between the VENDOR-BLOCK sentinels and diffs the remainder against
# upstream's current `dev`; the strip is exact, so a clean tree diffs empty.
# Divergence is reported as a warning annotation rather than a failure --
# both copies still work, so by this script's own asymmetry it is "will
# mislead later", not "broken now", and a checker that reddens this repo
# because a different repo merged something is a checker people switch off.
# An upstream that cannot be read at all IS fatal under $CI, for the same
# reason resolution failure is fatal everywhere else here.
#
# Update by changing upstream first, then re-copying and bumping `revision`.
# --- VENDOR-BLOCK END ------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The `main` -> `dev` migration across this repo family has now produced the
# same defect five separate times, in three different shapes, and none of them
# was caught by anything:
#
#   1. `uses: owner/repo/action@main` where the action repo has no `main`.
#      Every step using it fails to load. Eight of these were live on this
#      repo's `dev`.
#   2. `on: push: branches: [main]` where `main` was deleted. The workflow
#      simply never runs again, and a never-run workflow reports nothing at
#      all -- so the mainline looked clean because it was unchecked.
#   3. `with: ref: main` on a clone step. Five siblings had no `main` (hard
#      failure); one still had a frozen `main` a month behind its `dev`, so CI
#      quietly built a stale tree and reported it as current.
#
# THE TRAP THIS IS BUILT AROUND
#
# `git ls-remote --heads <url> main` exits 0 and prints NOTHING when the ref
# is absent. Any check written around its exit status therefore passes. This
# script tests the OUTPUT, never the status. That single distinction is what
# eight dead references survived.
#
# ASYMMETRY, DELIBERATELY ENCODED
#
# The three shapes do not fail alike, so they are not reported alike. A gate
# that cries wolf on the harmless case gets disabled by whoever hits it first.
#
#   * A `uses:` or `ref:` naming an absent branch is FATAL -- the job breaks.
#   * A `uses:` or `ref:` naming a `main`/`master` that resolves but is NOT
#     that repo's default is FATAL -- this is the quiet regime that builds a
#     frozen tree and reports it as current. It is the one a resolve-only
#     check misses.
#   * A push-trigger branch filter listing a branch that does not exist is
#     only a WARNING: a filter entry that matches nothing is inert.
#   * ...UNLESS no entry in the filter exists, in which case the workflow can
#     never trigger on push at all, and that is FATAL.
#
# Version tags (`@v4`, `@v1.2.3`) and 40-hex SHAs are not branch names and are
# left alone.
#
# USAGE
#   ci/check-ci-refs.sh              scan .github/workflows against the network
#   ci/check-ci-refs.sh --self-test  run the hermetic self-tests (no network)
#
# NETWORK
#   Unreachable network is a FAILURE when $CI is set and a SKIP otherwise, so
#   the gate cannot be quietly satisfied by an offline runner.
